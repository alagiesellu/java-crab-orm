# Problem Statement

## 1. Inability of Database systems to keep track of previous data states
When records on a database are changed. How can the changes be tracked. Or how can one know the previous records?

## 2. Changes in database row make it difficul for data to be added on a blockchain ledger
Because of changes that happen on most databases, record must be confimed before being added to a blockchain ledger. And this record can never be change, that's good. But what if the record have takeup a new state.

For example; In a national ID system, someone can legally change his name. How can a database support such changes and be conviently deployed on a blockchain ledger?
